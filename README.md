# Food Recommendation App

A smart food recommendation system that helps users discover dishes based on their preferences, dietary needs, and caloric requirements. The app leverages machine learning (Logistic Regression) to recommend dishes and can be used both as a web application and via the terminal.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations:** Suggests dishes based on user profile, preferred flavors, cuisines, and dish categories.
- **Dietary Awareness:** Each dish is listed with its calories, ingredients, and dietary tags (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free).
- **Dual Interface:** Accessible as a web application and also runnable in the terminal/command line.
- **Machine Learning Powered:** Uses Logistic Regression for model training to improve recommendation accuracy.

## How It Works

1. **User Profile:** Users input their profile details, including dietary restrictions and preferences.
2. **Search:** Users specify what flavors, cuisines, or dish categories they are interested in.
3. **Recommendations:** The app suggests dishes that best match the userâ€™s input, showing relevant calories, ingredients, and tags.

## Technologies Used

- Python (for backend logic and model training)
- Logistic Regression (machine learning algorithm)
- Streamlit for the web interface
- Command line interface for terminal usage
